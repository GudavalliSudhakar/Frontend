        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Mahatma Gandhi (1869â€“1948) was a prominent Indian leader who played a crucial role in the Indian independence movement. He is widely recognized for his principles of nonviolent civil disobedience and his leadership in the struggle for India's independence from British rule.</p>

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India. He studied law in London and later worked as a lawyer in South Africa, where he experienced racial discrimination, which influenced his views on justice and equality.</p>

        <h2>Activism</h2>
        <p>Gandhi returned to India in 1915 and became a leader of the Indian National Congress. He led various movements advocating for nonviolent resistance to British rule, most notably the Salt March in 1930 and the Quit India Movement in 1942.</p>

        <h2>Independence Movement</h2>
        <p>Through his leadership, Gandhi galvanized millions of Indians to take part in peaceful protests, boycotts, and civil disobedience campaigns. His efforts ultimately led to the end of British colonial rule in India in 1947.</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence (ahimsa) and his commitment to truth and justice continue to inspire global movements for civil rights, peace, and social change.</p>
